- Simplify Rtwobitlib/src/twobit/Makefile.Rtwobitlib. The object files
  should be listed only once in a variable and that variable reused.

- Try to clean the *.c and *.h files in src/twobit/ to keep only what's
  needed to support the stuff in twoBit.c/twoBit.h

- Try to get rid of libcrypto dep (part of openssl). Only function used from
  libcrypto is SHA1().

- If can't get rid of libcrypto dep, then add configure script to package.

- Make the whole thing work on Windows.
