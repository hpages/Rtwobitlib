- Use 2bit file in man page and unit tests that has more than 1 sequence.

- More pruning of the C code in src/kent/, that is, try to clean the *.c
  and *.h files to keep only what's strictly needed to support the stuff
  in twoBit.c/twoBit.h

- Try to get rid of the remaining calls to exit() in src/kent/*.c
