- Prune C code in src/twobit/ i.e. try to clean the *.c and *.h files to keep
  only what's strictly needed to support the stuff in twoBit.c/twoBit.h

- Try to get rid of the remaining calls to exit() in src/twobit/*.c

- Try to get rid of libcrypto dep (part of openssl). Only function used from
  libcrypto is SHA1(). If this works then update SystemRequirements,
  src/Makevars, and src/twobit/Makefile.Rtwobitlib, and get rid of files
  configure.ac, configure, INSTALL.

- Make the whole thing work on Windows.
