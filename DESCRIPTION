Package: Rtwobitlib
Title: 2bit C Library
Description: A trimmed down copy of the Kent source tree
	turned into a C library for manipulation of 2bit files.
	See <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7>
	for a quick overview of the 2bit format. The Kent source tree
	can be found here: <https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/>.
	Only the .c and .h files from the source tree that are related
	to manipulation of 2bit files were kept. Note that the package
	is primarily useful to developers of other R packages who wish
	to use the 2bit C library in their own C code.
