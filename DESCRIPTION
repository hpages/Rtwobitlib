Package: Rtwobitlib
Title: '2bit' 'C' Library
Description: A trimmed down copy of the "kent-core source tree"
	turned into a 'C' library for manipulation of '.2bit' files.
	See <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7>
	for a quick overview of the '2bit' format. The "kent-core source tree"
	can be found here: <https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent-core/>.
	Only the '.c' and '.h' files from the source tree that are related
	to manipulation of '.2bit' files were kept. Note that the package
	is primarily useful to developers of other R packages who wish
	to use the '2bit' 'C' library in their own 'C'/'C++' code.
