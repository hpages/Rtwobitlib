 *   protocol://user:password@server.com:port/path/filename?var1=val1&var2=val2

 * Note that a space should only be encoded to a plus and decoded from a plus
 * when dealing with http URLs in the query part of the string,
 * which is the part after the ? above.
 * It should not be used in the rest of the URL.  
 * So in the query string part of a URL, do use cgiEncode/cgiDecode. 
 * And in the rest of the URL, use cgiEncodeFUll/cgiDecodeFull 
 * which do not code space as plus.
 * Since FTP does not use URLs with query parameters, use the Full version.
