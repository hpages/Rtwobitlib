We're not supporting the twoBitOpenExternalBptIndex functionality at the
moment. Note that supporting it would require to link the package to libcrypto
because the code in kent-core-463/src/lib/udc.c calls SHA1() from the crypto
library in openssl. See src/kent/README.txt for more information.

In addition to the steps described in src/kent/README.txt, supporting
twoBitOpenExternalBptIndex would require restoring the configure.ac,
configure, and INSTALL files, and to modify src/Makevars, src/Makevars.win,
src/kent/Makefile.Rtwobitlib, and src/kent/Makefile.Rtwobitlib.win.
Finally, the SystemRequirements field in DESCRIPTION would need to be
updated to contain:

SystemRequirements: GNU make; openssl & header files
